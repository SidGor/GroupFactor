The key function of this module is to perform regressions, all sorts of them,
to statistically explain past performances of stocks/thems/indexes. 

It should contain two options at least:

1. Models to choos, time-series, crosssectional, panel data or so on.

2. Special handling on data, to see researchers like to analyze the whole 
package, period of time or certain group of stocks.
