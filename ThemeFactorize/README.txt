This module will be inheriting an old local project. Which loads Wind stock theme tag and
convert a "stock - theme" data structure in to a "theme-stock" data structure, which means 
we need to figure out which stocks are under given "theme". Then calculate the factor 
exposure along with factor performances.

The concept "theme" could be conclude as subsets of a certain logics that devide stocks into
groups. Industry for example is such a logic, and "food/drinks" is a "theme". 

Them logic can be exclusive like industries (Most of time a stock should belongs to 1 industry),
or non-exclusive such as by supplie chain, one stock belongs to steel chain might also belongs 
to motor manufacturing chain.
